Why are Stuy kids always asking if you have food? Because they're always hungry! 
Help satisfy the students' hunger by simply holding down the A and D keys to open the mouth of the left and right cat, resp. to feed them endless amounts of the famous Unicorn Frappuccino.
But wait! There's a catch. What don't Stuy kids like? Nasty cafeteria food is what! 
Beware and do not let the students eat the moldy cafeteria pizza or it's game over. Try to beat your friend's and friends of friend's  high score! You can even unlock special Stuy avatars when trade in 30 frappes in the Nom Frappe vending machine (some avatars may even be teachers and faculty :O)!
